About Aurealis:

Aurealis is a web-based interactive story designed to introduce elementary and middle school students to the concept of space weather, especially how auroras are formed and how solar activity affects astronauts and pilots. By transforming real scientific information from NASA into a creative digital experience, the project addresses the challenge of explaining space weather in a way that is both factual and child-friendly. This is important because it helps kids get interested in science and understand how the sun affects life on earth.
